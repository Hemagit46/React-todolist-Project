# React Authentication Project

This is a simple React project that demonstrates **user authentication** using `localStorage`. The project includes pages for Home, Login, and Register, allowing users to create an account, log in, and access the home page.

---

## Features

- **Home Page** (`Home.jsx`): Accessible after login. Displays a welcome message or user info.
- **Login Page** (`Login.jsx`): Allows users to log in with registered credentials.
- **Register Page** (`Register.jsx`): Allows new users to create an account.
- **Local Storage**: Stores user credentials locally (for demonstration purposes only; not secure for production).

---

## Technologies Used

- React (Functional Components)
- React Router (for navigation between pages)
- Local Storage (to store user credentials)
- CSS (optional styling)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
